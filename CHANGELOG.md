#### `komodo_defi_sdk` - `v0.8.0-rc.1`

 - **BREAKING** **FIX**(auth): metadata writes through `KomodoDefiSdk.auth`
   require the verified wallet identity captured when the operation starts.
   Reject stale operations before they can update a replacement wallet.
 - **FIX**(history): retain verified identity and active history streams during
   degraded same-wallet authentication events.
 - **FIX**(history): retain one wallet context across historical and live results
   so old-wallet rows cannot enter a replacement wallet's stream.
 - **FIX**(history): validate the wallet before recording activation and recheck
   the session synchronously immediately before the marker is added. This also
   closes the asynchronous return gap on WebAssembly.
 - **TEST**(history): cover wallet switching during activation in native and
   Chrome/WebAssembly tests, including the Wasm suite in CI.
 - **CHORE**(deps): require `komodo_defi_local_auth` `^0.6.0-rc.1`.

#### `komodo_defi_local_auth` - `v0.6.0-rc.1`

 - **BREAKING** **FIX**(auth): require `expectedWalletId` for metadata setters
   and atomic updates, including custom auth implementations and Trezor
   forwarding. Callers must capture the original identity before asynchronous
   work and retain it through every write and rollback.
 - **FIX**(auth): reject missing public-key hashes and changed wallets under the
   authentication write lock, before transformation or persistence. This prevents
   a stale confirmation from updating a different seed recreated under the same
   name during an identity lookup outage.
 - **DOCS**(auth): document [caller migration](packages/komodo_defi_local_auth/README.md#migrating-metadata-writes)
   and explicit prerelease adoption.

These versions prepare the release candidate in [PR #374](https://github.com/GLEECBTC/komodo-defi-sdk-flutter/pull/374).
They do not indicate that packages have been published. The KDF binary, coin
configuration pins, and stored-data format are unchanged.

#### `komodo_defi_sdk` - `v0.7.0`

> Note: This release has breaking GasFree activation and withdrawal behavior.

 - **BREAKING** **FEAT**(gasfree): derive token enrollment only from activated
   TRC20 `gasless.enabled` configuration and require an authoritative
   account-status check before custody balance or sends become available.
   Applications may amend normalized asset configuration before SDK parsing
   through `assetConfigTransform`.
 - **BREAKING** **FEAT**(gasfree): configure the documented
   `tron_gasless_provider` and per-token `gasless` fields during ordinary TRON
   activation. Remove runtime `gasless::configure`, its restart fallback, and
   the legacy V0/V1/bound compatibility contracts.
 - **BREAKING** **FEAT**(gasfree): adopt the required four-state account status
   contract (`available`, `pending_transfer`, `token_unsupported`, and
   `provider_unreachable`) with endpoint-typed provider, custody-address, and
   token-decimal errors.
 - **SECURITY**(gasfree): persist a wallet-scoped local `journalId` before
   submission, never serialize it to KDF, retain unknown outcomes without
   resubmitting, and migrate accepted records with a trace ID into trace
   recovery.
 - **FEAT**(gasfree): subscribe to `GASLESS_TRACE:<coin>` before submission,
   persist KDF's accepted `trace_id`, reconcile it once immediately, and follow
   matching success/error stream events. Restart and disconnect recovery use a
   one-shot `gasless::trace_status` request.
 - **BREAKING** **FIX**(gasfree): serialize only KDF's documented withdrawal and
   relay fields, report the actual Standard/GasFree submission rail, and obtain
   final fee and finality from trace status rather than preview metadata.
 - **FIX**(gasfree): treat account-status `max_withdrawable` as an advisory
   status value and delegate maximum sends to KDF with `max: true` and no
   amount.
 - **FIX**(gasfree): retain custody/recovery access during provider outages,
   preserve KDF-compatible Iguana, software-HD, and hardware-HD activation
   identities, preserve cross-page address perspectives, and expose final fee
   plus confirmation metadata without enabling resubmission.
 - **FIX**(pubkeys): migrate legacy address metadata conservatively so funded
   and previously used Standard addresses remain visible.
 - **FIX**(gasfree): keep KDF's fresh custody total distinct from provider
   spendability and Standard balances; remove external custody-balance and
   finality readers.
 - **FEAT**(activation): expose per-asset activation state through
   `activationStates`, `watchActivationStates` and `watchActivationStateOf`,
   and reach a terminal state on every path - a progress stream that never
   emits and never closes no longer strands the caller past its deadline.
 - **FEAT**(transaction-history): persist transaction history to disk. A coin's
   history is served from local storage on a cold start and the network walk
   that follows is a refresh rather than a first fetch. On by default, with
   unbounded retention; `KomodoDefiSdkConfig` gates it.
 - **FEAT**(transaction-history): add a Blockscout strategy so GLEEC and GRC-20
   report history instead of returning an empty list.
 - **FEAT**(balances): paint balances from local storage before activation
   completes, and keep the balance watcher alive across a transport blip or a
   degraded wallet identity rather than emitting nothing at all.
 - **PERF**(pubkeys): scale the HD address gap scan through `HdGapLimit` -
   3 addresses, or 1 on a newly generated wallet's first sign-in, against KDF's
   default of 20 - and skip the redundant post-activation scan. Hardware
   wallets keep the full gap of 20. Measured single-coin HD activation falls
   from 46.9s to roughly 13.1s.
 - **PERF**(auth): cut the identity RPCs issued on every sign-in and stop
   activation precaching from blocking first paint.
 - **FIX**(wallets): purge wallet-scoped caches - derived addresses, activation
   config, enabled assets, transaction history - inside `deleteWallet` via the
   new `KomodoDefiAuth.onWalletDeletion` hook, so deleting and immediately
   recreating a wallet cannot race a still-running purge.
 - **FIX**(balances): read cached public keys only after the undelivered
   wallet-switch check, so a balance cannot be painted from the previous wallet.
 - **FIX**(gasfree): discard an untraced pending transfer under a single lock,
   so a reservation belonging to an accepted transfer can no longer be stripped
   between the lookup and the removal.
 - **FIX**(deps): declare `meta`, which `activation_strategy_base.dart`
   imports, and the `flutter_test` and `plugin_platform_interface` dev
   dependencies the tests import. They resolved only through the workspace, so
   `dart pub publish` rejected the package.
 - **FIX**(deps): raise the `flutter_secure_storage` lower bound off the
   `10.0.0-beta.4` pre-release to `^10.0.0`. It already resolved to a stable
   10.x, and pub warns when a stable release depends on a pre-release.

#### `komodo_defi_types` - `v0.5.0`

> Note: This release has breaking GasFree withdrawal interfaces.

 - **BREAKING** **FEAT**(gasfree): align provider activation, fee preview,
   signed relay, submission, and receipt models with the final KDF contract.
 - **BREAKING** **FIX**(gasfree): obtain accepted trace identity and final fee
   from submission/trace status instead of preview or provider echoes.
 - **BREAKING** **FIX**(withdraw): enforce mutually exclusive explicit-amount
   and maximum request modes, omitting `amount` whenever `max` is true.
 - **SECURITY**(gasfree): persist only wallet-scoped journal and trace recovery
   data, never signed authorization material or provider credentials.
 - **FEAT**(gasfree): rename the local reservation identity to `journalId`;
   migrate trace-backed records and keep trace-less records outcome-unknown.
 - **BREAKING** **REFACTOR**(activation): remove `BatchActivationProgress`.
   Multi-asset progress is now tracked by the SDK's activation coordinator and
   surfaced as `AssetActivationState`; `ActivationProgress` itself is unchanged.
 - **FEAT**(activation): add `AssetActivationState` and `AssetActivationStatus`
   for per-asset activation state with a guaranteed terminal value.
 - **FEAT**(pubkeys): add `HdGapLimit`, which resolves the HD address gap to
   scan - 3 by default, 1 on a newly generated wallet's first sign-in, and the
   full 20 for hardware wallets.
 - **FIX**(transactions): make transaction identity and ordering stable enough
   to persist and re-read, so a stored history round-trips without duplicates.
 - **SECURITY**(logging): replace the log-censoring key list with a set that
   also covers authorization headers, bearer/API tokens, cookies and GasFree
   authorization material, and redact to `<redacted>` rather than a run of
   asterisks that leaked the value's length.
 - **FIX**(deps): declare the `flutter_test` dev dependency that
   `sia_protocol_test.dart` imports.
 - **CHORE**(analysis): drop two null assertions the analyzer proves are
   no-ops, which `dart pub publish` reports as warnings.

#### `komodo_defi_rpc_methods` - `v0.6.0`

> Note: This release has breaking GasFree relay response interfaces.

 - **BREAKING** **FEAT**(gasfree): adopt the final activation, four-state account
   status, signed relay, submission, and trace settlement contracts.
 - **FEAT**(gasfree): add typed `stream::gasless_trace::enable` success and
   error events for coin-scoped trace reconciliation.
 - **SECURITY**(gasfree): remove request/fingerprint/expected-authorization
   compatibility fields and reject undocumented relay generations.
 - **FIX**(gasfree): generate endpoint-scoped account, withdrawal, trace, and
   streaming exceptions from the pinned KDF Rust error enums.
 - **FIX**(gasfree): serialize maximum withdrawals with `max: true` and no
   `amount`, and serialize only documented GasFree withdrawal options.
 - **FEAT**(activation): send the HD address `gap_limit` on the wire for the
   activation methods that accept it, so callers can scan fewer addresses than
   KDF's default of 20.
 - **FEAT**(activation): add WebSocket expansion of EVM node entries, gated off
   on both web and native for this release: KDF `main` panics on a `wss://`
   reply that lands after the caller's timeout, so only HTTP nodes are sent.
 - **FIX**(requests): encode request bodies through a single encodable path so
   nested parameter objects serialize consistently.

#### `komodo_defi_framework` - `v0.5.0`

> Note: This release rolls the bundled KDF to the `3.1.0-beta` line.

 - **BREAKING** **BUILD**(kdf): pin the bundled artefact to KDF `main`
   `f3efd2ca10420f2982fa127dde84dcc17891f577` (`3.1.0-beta_f3efd2c`) for all
   seven native/WASM targets. This reprices EVM swap gas under the
   Amsterdam/Bogota fork rules and is visible in fee estimates.
 - **BREAKING** **BUILD**(kdf): require a full 40-character commit hash and
   declare `required_platforms`, so a partial or missing platform fails the
   build instead of shipping a stale artefact.
 - **SECURITY**(build): restrict bundled KDF sources to the official Devbuilds
   and Nebula mirrors. Keep `devbuilds.gleec.com` first for `main/` builds.
 - **FEAT**(streaming): add typed `GASLESS_TRACE` events and rework the web and
   IO event-stream transports around a single service lifecycle.
 - **FEAT**(config): allow an `IKdfOperations` implementation to be injected,
   and export `KdfExecutableFinder` and `KdfOperationsLocalExecutable` so a test
   harness can drive the real binary through the framework's own lifecycle.
 - **FIX**(android): align native LOAD segments to 16 KB pages (#355).
 - **SECURITY**(logging): stop logging full activation parameters, and suppress
   verbose RPC logging for GasFree requests, whose bodies carry provider
   credentials and signed authorization material.
 - **CHORE**(build): drop the committed `CMakeCache.txt`, `Makefile` and
   `cmake_install.cmake`. The cache recorded absolute paths from the machine
   that generated it, and CMake refuses to configure a directory whose cache
   came from elsewhere (#362).

#### `komodo_wallet_build_transformer` - `v0.5.0`

 - **BREAKING** **FEAT**(build): write and verify artefact provenance markers
   next to each extracted KDF artefact. A marker is authoritative only when it
   identifies the pinned commit, the downloaded archive, the extracted core
   artefact and the complete platform runtime set; legacy partial markers fail
   closed and force a re-fetch.
 - **FEAT**(build): support `require_full_commit_hash` and `required_platforms`
   in the API build config, so an incomplete pin fails the build.
 - **FIX**(build): discard the Rust proc-macro DLLs that KDF's Windows archive
   ships, which the owned-runtime guard otherwise rejected - failing every
   `flutter test` that runs the transformer.
 - **FIX**(assets): decide whether a platform asset needs recopying by
   comparing SHA-256 content rather than modification time, which a checkout or
   a restored cache can reorder.

#### `komodo_wallet_cli` - `v0.6.0`

 - **BREAKING** **FEAT**(update-api-config): default to the `main` branch of the
   private `GLEECBTC/kdf-internal` repository. `--source github` against it now
   needs a `--token` with read access.
 - **FEAT**(update-api-config): resolve short commit SHAs remotely and write
   only a full 40-character lowercase SHA; add `--strict` to require
   exact commit-matching artefacts, `--mirror-url` to pin the mirror, and a
   platform update scope that only lets `--platform all` change the pinned
   commit.
 - **FIX**(update-api-config): match a mirror listing's links by the artefact
   filename contract applied to the href's basename, so bare filenames,
   relative paths and absolute URLs all resolve alike.
 - **FIX**(update-api-config): keep an independently trusted checksum set
   unchanged when the pinned commit has not moved, rather than replacing it
   with whatever the current download calculated.

#### `komodo_defi_local_auth` - `v0.5.0`

 - **FEAT**(auth): add `KomodoDefiAuth.onWalletDeletion`, an awaited hook that
   runs inside `deleteWallet` after KDF and secure storage have forgotten the
   wallet but before the call returns. Wallet-scoped cache owners register here
   so deleting and immediately recreating the same wallet cannot race a
   still-running purge; the `walletDeletions` stream remains for passive
   observers.
 - **FIX**(auth): stop treating a transient transport failure as an
   authentication failure - a brief network drop no longer ends the session.
 - **FIX**(auth): resolve the deleted wallet's identity before deletion, since
   it cannot be recovered afterwards.
 - **FIX**(trezor): surface the device's own message in `TrezorException`
   instead of `GeneralErrorResponse.toString()`, which is deliberately reduced
   to its `error_type` to keep request payloads out of logs and so read as
   `GeneralErrorResponse(errorType: ...)` to the user. `error_data` is still
   never included.
 - **FIX**(storage): open Android secure storage with `resetOnError: false`, so
   a read failure surfaces instead of silently clearing stored credentials.
 - **FIX**(deps): raise the `flutter_secure_storage` lower bound off the
   `10.0.0-beta.4` pre-release to `^10.0.0`. It already resolved to a stable
   10.x, and pub warns when a stable release depends on a pre-release.

#### `komodo_coins` - `v0.4.0`

 - **BREAKING** **FIX**(assets): return `filteredAssets` as an ordered snapshot
   keyed by `AssetId` equality rather than the live `SplayTreeMap` behind the
   filter cache. The tree's comparator orders on `AssetId.toString()`, which
   omits the chain id and includes the parent, so lookups on it missed ids that
   were `==` to a stored key - every child-token id parsed without known
   parents, as `Transaction.fromJson` does. The returned map is now a stable,
   unmodifiable snapshot, so it is also safe to iterate across an await.
 - **PERF**(assets): memoise the filtered snapshot per strategy, invalidating it
   with the underlying cache. `filteredAssets` is on every `available` read.
 - **FIX**(tests): correct long-stale expectations - a `type: 'UTXO'` fixture is
   tagged `CoinSubClass.utxo`, not `smartChain`, since #244, and a custom token
   colliding with a bundled asset takes over its slot rather than being stored
   beside it under a renamed id.

#### `komodo_coin_updates` - `v2.1.0`

 - **FEAT**(config): add `CoinConfigTransformer.additionalTransforms`, applied
   after the built-in normalization set so an application can amend normalized
   asset configuration without replacing SDK defaults.
 - **FEAT**(tron): add `TronQuickNodeTransform`, keeping mainnet TRX and TRC20
   assets pointed at the Gleec proxy while preserving upstream fallback nodes.
 - **FIX**(custom-tokens): stop rejecting a re-store of an existing custom token
   as a contract collision. Assets read back through `AssetAdapter` are rebuilt
   without known parent ids, so the stored copy never carries a `parentId`;
   comparing that absence against a live parsed parent made every `upsert` and
   `addCustomTokenIfNotExists` on an existing token throw. Parents are now only
   compared when both sides carry one - a differing contract address still
   conflicts.

#### `komodo_ui` - `v0.3.3`

 - **FEAT**(withdraw): render GasFree fees - provider, transfer fee and optional
   account-activation fee - in `FeeInfoDisplay`.
 - **FEAT**(withdraw): parameterise the withdrawal amount field's labels so host
   applications can localise them, and rework its max/send-maximum controls to
   stay usable at large text scales.
 - **FIX**(addresses): correct address selection and formatting in the address
   select input and recipient/source fields.
 - **CHORE**(analysis): drop two null assertions the analyzer proves are
   no-ops, which `dart pub publish` reports as warnings.

#### `komodo_legacy_wallet_migration` - `v0.1.1`

 - **FIX**(android): open legacy encrypted shared preferences with
   `resetOnError: false`, so a read failure surfaces instead of silently
   clearing the legacy wallet data the migration exists to read.
 - **FIX**(deps): raise the `flutter_secure_storage` lower bound off the
   `10.0.0-beta.4` pre-release to `^10.0.0`. It already resolved to a stable
   10.x, and pub warns when a stable release depends on a pre-release.

#### `komodo_cex_market_data` - `v0.1.0+2`

 - **FIX**(deps): declare `collection`, which `id_resolution_strategy.dart`
   imports. It resolved only through the workspace, so `dart pub publish`
   rejected the package.
 - Update a dependency to the latest release.
