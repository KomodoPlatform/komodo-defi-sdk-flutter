# Komodo Defi Framework SDK for Flutter

A series of Flutter packages for integrating the Komodo DeFi Framework into Flutter applications. 

The primary entry point ([komodo_defi_sdk](/packages/komodo_defi_sdk/README.md)) is a high-level opinionated library that provides a simple way to build cross-platform Komodo Defi Framework applications (primarily focused on wallets). This repository consists of multiple other child-packages in the [packages](.packages) folder which are orchestrated by the `komodo_defi_sdk` package.

For an unopinionated implementation which gives access to the underlying KDF methods, use the [komodo_defi_framework](packages/komodo_defi_sdk) package.

The structure for this repository is inspired by the [Flutter BLoC](https://github.com/felangel/bloc) project.

This project generally aligns itself with the guidelines and high-standard set by [Very Good Ventures](https://vgv.dev/).
