/// RPC namespace for trading and swap operations.
///
/// This namespace provides methods for managing atomic swaps and trading
/// operations within the Komodo DeFi Framework. It enables users to initiate,
/// monitor, and manage cross-chain atomic swaps in a decentralized manner.
///
/// ## Key Features:
///
/// - **Swap Initiation**: Start new swaps as maker or taker
/// - **Swap Monitoring**: Track active and recent swap status
/// - **Trade Analysis**: Calculate fees and validate trade parameters
/// - **Swap Management**: Cancel active swaps when needed
///
/// ## Swap Types:
///
/// - **Maker**: Sets an order at a specific price and waits for takers
/// - **Taker**: Takes existing orders from the orderbook immediately
///
/// ## Usage Example:
///
/// ```dart
/// final trading = client.trading;
///
/// // Start a new swap
/// final swap = await trading.startSwap(
///   swapRequest: SwapRequest(
///     base: 'BTC',
///     rel: 'KMD',
///     baseCoinAmount: '0.1',
///     relCoinAmount: '1000',
///     method: SwapMethod.sell,
///   ),
/// );
///
/// // Monitor swap status
/// final status = await trading.swapStatus(uuid: swap.uuid);
/// ```

  /// Initiates a new atomic swap.
  ///
  /// This method starts a new cross-chain atomic swap based on the provided
  /// parameters. The swap can be initiated as either a maker (placing an order)
  /// or a taker (taking an existing order).
  ///
  /// - [swapRequest]: The swap configuration including coins, amounts, and method
  /// - [rpcPass]: Optional RPC password override
  ///
  /// Returns a [Future] that completes with a [StartSwapResponse] containing
  /// the swap UUID and initial status.
  ///
  /// ## Swap Methods:
  ///
  /// - **setPrice**: Creates a maker order at a specific price
  /// - **buy**: Takes the best available sell orders (taker)
  /// - **sell**: Takes the best available buy orders (taker)
  ///
  /// Throws an exception if:
  /// - Insufficient balance for the swap
  /// - No matching orders available (for taker swaps)
  /// - Invalid swap parameters
