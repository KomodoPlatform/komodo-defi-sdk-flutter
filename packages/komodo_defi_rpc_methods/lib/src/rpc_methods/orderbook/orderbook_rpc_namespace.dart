/// RPC namespace for orderbook operations.
///
/// This namespace provides methods for interacting with the decentralized
/// orderbook in the Komodo DeFi Framework. It enables users to view market
/// depth, place orders, and manage their trading positions.
///
/// ## Key Features:
///
/// - **Market Data**: View orderbook depth and best prices
/// - **Order Management**: Place, cancel, and monitor orders
/// - **Price Discovery**: Find the best available prices for trades
/// - **Order Types**: Support for both maker and taker orders
///
/// ## Order Lifecycle:
///
/// 1. **Creation**: Orders are placed using `setOrder`
/// 2. **Matching**: Orders wait in the orderbook for matching
/// 3. **Execution**: Matched orders proceed to atomic swap
/// 4. **Completion**: Orders are removed after execution or cancellation
///
/// ## Usage Example:
///
/// ```dart
/// final orderbook = client.orderbook;
///
/// // View orderbook
/// final book = await orderbook.orderbook(
///   base: 'BTC',
///   rel: 'KMD',
/// );
///
/// // Place an order
/// final order = await orderbook.setOrder(
///   base: 'BTC',
///   rel: 'KMD',
///   price: '100',
///   volume: '0.1',
/// );
/// ```
