## 0.4.0 (unreleased)

 - **CHORE**(deps): require `komodo_defi_types` `^0.6.0`, `komodo_coin_updates` `^2.1.1` for SDK 0.8.0;
   retain this package version from the earlier preparation milestone.

 - **BREAKING** **FIX**(assets): return `filteredAssets` as an ordered snapshot
   keyed by `AssetId` equality rather than the live `SplayTreeMap` behind the
   filter cache. The tree's comparator orders on `AssetId.toString()`, which
   omits the chain id and includes the parent, so lookups on it missed ids that
   were `==` to a stored key - every child-token id parsed without known
   parents, as `Transaction.fromJson` does. The returned map is now a stable,
   unmodifiable snapshot, so it is also safe to iterate across an await.
 - **PERF**(assets): memoise the filtered snapshot per strategy, invalidating it
   with the underlying cache. `filteredAssets` is on every `available` read.
 - **FIX**(tests): correct long-stale expectations - a `type: 'UTXO'` fixture is
   tagged `CoinSubClass.utxo`, not `smartChain`, since #244, and a custom token
   colliding with a bundled asset takes over its slot rather than being stored
   beside it under a renamed id.
