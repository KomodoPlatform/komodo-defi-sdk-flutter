/// Transaction history persisted in a lazy Hive box.
///
/// ## Shape
///
/// One box entry per transaction, keyed by [TransactionStorageKey]. Ordering,
/// pagination, lookups and stats are served by [TransactionOrderIndex], which
/// is rebuilt from the box's keys at open. Values therefore stay on disk until
/// a row is actually returned: a cold open costs one pass over the key list and
/// zero record decodes, and `getLatestTransactionId` - polled per watched asset
/// every 30 seconds - costs neither.
///
/// A per-transaction entry rather than one blob per asset is what keeps writes
/// proportional to what changed. Production stores a page at a time and
/// re-stores page one on every confirmations refresh; against a per-asset blob
/// that would rewrite the entire history each time, and Hive's VM backend is an
/// append-only log, so every rewrite stays on disk until compaction.
///
/// ## Failure posture
///
/// Throw for caller bugs, degrade for I/O. Transaction history is fully
/// reconstructible from the network, so no storage fault should be able to
/// break the wallet:
///
/// * Validation errors - an empty internal ID, an unknown pagination cursor -
///   throw [TransactionStorageException], exactly as the in-memory store does.
/// * A box that will not open is deleted and reopened once; if that also fails
///   the instance falls back to an in-memory store for the rest of the process
///   and reports [isDegraded]. Construction and first use never throw.
/// * A record that will not decode is skipped and evicted, leaving the rest of
///   the asset's history readable. This per-record containment is why the box
///   is lazy: a non-lazy box decodes everything at open, so one bad frame would
///   take the whole dataset with it.
/// * A failed write is logged and swallowed. The caller already has the rows it
///   fetched; failing a *cache* write must not turn a successful network fetch
///   into a user-visible error.
