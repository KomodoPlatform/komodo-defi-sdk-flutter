# One-Click Migration Feature - Action Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

This action plan outlines the step-by-step implementation of the one-click migration feature for the Komodo DeFi SDK Flutter package. The feature enables users to migrate cryptocurrency balances from one wallet to another (primarily from Iguana to HD wallets) in a single operation.

## 2. Project Scope & Objectives

### Primary Objectives
- Enable seamless migration of all coin balances from source to target wallet
- Provide transparent preview of migration costs and outcomes
- Implement robust error handling with clear user feedback
- Maintain security standards with local key management
- Support flexible wallet-to-wallet migrations (not limited to Iguana→HD)

### Success Metrics
- Zero fund loss during migration
- >95% user satisfaction with migration experience
- <30 second average migration preview generation
- Support for 50+ concurrent asset migrations
- >90% test coverage across all components

## 3. Technical Architecture Summary

The implementation follows the established clean architecture pattern:

```
Presentation Layer (BLoC Pattern)
    ↓
Domain Layer (MigrationManager + Models)
    ↓
Data Layer (Existing SDK Services)
```

### Core Components
- **MigrationManager**: Central orchestration service
- **Migration BLoC**: UI state management
