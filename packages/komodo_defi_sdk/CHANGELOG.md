## 0.8.0-rc.1

Release candidate for the wallet-identity hotfix. Metadata writes have a breaking
API change; this is not a source-compatible patch of 0.7.0.

 - **FIX**(history): preserve verified wallet identity and active history streams
   during degraded same-wallet authentication events.
 - **FIX**(history): retain one wallet context across historical and live results
   so a wallet switch cannot carry the previous wallet's rows into the new stream.
 - **FIX**(history): recheck the wallet session synchronously before recording
   activation. On WebAssembly, an auth event can run after asynchronous
   validation completes and otherwise mark the replacement wallet activated.
 - **BREAKING** **FIX**(auth): `sdk.auth` metadata setters and atomic updates
   require the original `expectedWalletId`. Writes fail closed when identity
   cannot be verified or the active wallet changes. See the
   [local-auth migration guidance](../komodo_defi_local_auth/README.md#migrating-metadata-writes).
 - **CHORE**(deps): require `komodo_defi_local_auth` `^0.6.0-rc.1`.
 - **TEST**(history): run wallet-race regressions in Chrome/WebAssembly in CI.

## 0.7.0

> Note: This release has breaking GasFree activation and withdrawal behavior.

 - **BREAKING** **FEAT**(gasfree): derive token enrollment only from activated
   TRC20 `gasless.enabled` configuration and require an authoritative
   account-status check before custody balance or sends become available.
   Applications may amend normalized asset configuration before SDK parsing
   through `assetConfigTransform`.
 - **BREAKING** **FEAT**(gasfree): configure the documented
   `tron_gasless_provider` and per-token `gasless` fields during ordinary TRON
   activation. Remove runtime `gasless::configure`, its restart fallback, and
   the legacy V0/V1/bound compatibility contracts.
 - **BREAKING** **FEAT**(gasfree): adopt the required four-state account status
   contract (`available`, `pending_transfer`, `token_unsupported`, and
   `provider_unreachable`) with endpoint-typed provider, custody-address, and
   token-decimal errors.
 - **SECURITY**(gasfree): persist a wallet-scoped local `journalId` before
   submission, never serialize it to KDF, retain unknown outcomes without
   resubmitting, and migrate accepted records with a trace ID into trace
   recovery.
 - **FEAT**(gasfree): subscribe to `GASLESS_TRACE:<coin>` before submission,
   persist KDF's accepted `trace_id`, reconcile it once immediately, and follow
   matching success/error stream events. Restart and disconnect recovery use a
   one-shot `gasless::trace_status` request.
 - **BREAKING** **FIX**(gasfree): serialize only KDF's documented withdrawal and
   relay fields, report the actual Standard/GasFree submission rail, and obtain
   final fee and finality from trace status rather than preview metadata.
 - **FIX**(gasfree): treat account-status `max_withdrawable` as an advisory
   status value and delegate maximum sends to KDF with `max: true` and no
   amount.
 - **FIX**(gasfree): retain custody/recovery access during provider outages,
   preserve KDF-compatible Iguana, software-HD, and hardware-HD activation
   identities, preserve cross-page address perspectives, and expose final fee
   plus confirmation metadata without enabling resubmission.
 - **FIX**(pubkeys): migrate legacy address metadata conservatively so funded
   and previously used Standard addresses remain visible.
 - **FIX**(gasfree): keep KDF's fresh custody total distinct from provider
   spendability and Standard balances; remove external custody-balance and
   finality readers.
 - **FEAT**(activation): expose per-asset activation state through
   `activationStates`, `watchActivationStates` and `watchActivationStateOf`,
   and reach a terminal state on every path - a progress stream that never
   emits and never closes no longer strands the caller past its deadline.
 - **FEAT**(transaction-history): persist transaction history to disk. A coin's
   history is served from local storage on a cold start and the network walk
   that follows is a refresh rather than a first fetch. On by default, with
   unbounded retention; `KomodoDefiSdkConfig` gates it.
 - **FEAT**(transaction-history): add a Blockscout strategy so GLEEC and GRC-20
   report history instead of returning an empty list.
 - **FEAT**(balances): paint balances from local storage before activation
   completes, and keep the balance watcher alive across a transport blip or a
   degraded wallet identity rather than emitting nothing at all.
 - **PERF**(pubkeys): scale the HD address gap scan through `HdGapLimit` -
   3 addresses, or 1 on a newly generated wallet's first sign-in, against KDF's
   default of 20 - and skip the redundant post-activation scan. Hardware
   wallets keep the full gap of 20. Measured single-coin HD activation falls
   from 46.9s to roughly 13.1s.
 - **PERF**(auth): cut the identity RPCs issued on every sign-in and stop
   activation precaching from blocking first paint.
 - **FIX**(wallets): purge wallet-scoped caches - derived addresses, activation
   config, enabled assets, transaction history - inside `deleteWallet` via the
   new `KomodoDefiAuth.onWalletDeletion` hook, so deleting and immediately
   recreating a wallet cannot race a still-running purge.
 - **FIX**(balances): read cached public keys only after the undelivered
   wallet-switch check, so a balance cannot be painted from the previous wallet.
 - **FIX**(gasfree): discard an untraced pending transfer under a single lock,
   so a reservation belonging to an accepted transfer can no longer be stripped
   between the lookup and the removal.
 - **FIX**(deps): declare `meta`, which `activation_strategy_base.dart`
   imports, and the `flutter_test` and `plugin_platform_interface` dev
   dependencies the tests import. They resolved only through the workspace, so
   `dart pub publish` rejected the package.
 - **FIX**(deps): raise the `flutter_secure_storage` lower bound off the
   `10.0.0-beta.4` pre-release to `^10.0.0`. It already resolved to a stable
   10.x, and pub warns when a stable release depends on a pre-release.
