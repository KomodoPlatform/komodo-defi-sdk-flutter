## 0.6.0-rc.1

Release candidate for verified metadata writes. Callers and custom authentication
implementations must migrate before adopting this version.

 - **BREAKING** **FIX**(auth): require `expectedWalletId` on metadata setters
   and atomic updates, including custom auth implementations. Capture the
   original wallet identity before asynchronous work and forward it through
   every write. See [migration guidance](README.md#migrating-metadata-writes).
 - **FIX**(auth): reject metadata writes when either identity lacks a verified
   public-key hash, preventing stale confirmations from reaching a different
   wallet recreated under the same name during an identity lookup outage.

## 0.5.0

 - **FEAT**(auth): add `KomodoDefiAuth.onWalletDeletion`, an awaited hook that
   runs inside `deleteWallet` after KDF and secure storage have forgotten the
   wallet but before the call returns. Wallet-scoped cache owners register here
   so deleting and immediately recreating the same wallet cannot race a
   still-running purge; the `walletDeletions` stream remains for passive
   observers.
 - **FIX**(auth): stop treating a transient transport failure as an
   authentication failure - a brief network drop no longer ends the session.
 - **FIX**(auth): resolve the deleted wallet's identity before deletion, since
   it cannot be recovered afterwards.
 - **FIX**(trezor): surface the device's own message in `TrezorException`
   instead of `GeneralErrorResponse.toString()`, which is deliberately reduced
   to its `error_type` to keep request payloads out of logs and so read as
   `GeneralErrorResponse(errorType: ...)` to the user. `error_data` is still
   never included.
 - **FIX**(storage): open Android secure storage with `resetOnError: false`, so
   a read failure surfaces instead of silently clearing stored credentials.
 - **FIX**(deps): raise the `flutter_secure_storage` lower bound off the
   `10.0.0-beta.4` pre-release to `^10.0.0`. It already resolved to a stable
   10.x, and pub warns when a stable release depends on a pre-release.

## 0.4.1

 - **FIX**(auth,migration): wait for KDF RPC readiness and guard unsupported platforms during migration.
 - **FEAT**(migration): add local-auth integration for legacy wallet verification and import flows.
