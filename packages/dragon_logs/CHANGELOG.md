## 3.0.0-rc.1

> Note: This release candidate has breaking storage and logger interfaces.

 - **BREAKING** **FEAT**(storage): `LogStorage.init` and `LoggerInterface.init`
   take `storageNamespace` and `purgeLegacy`, both interfaces gained `dispose`,
   and `FileLogStorage` is no longer a process-wide singleton. `DragonLogs.init`
   mirrors the new parameters and every API now fails closed before it runs.
 - **FEAT**(storage): version persisted storage by namespace and purge records
   written by an older, unversioned client before the new epoch is created.
 - **FEAT**(diagnostics): add `DragonLogs.writeRecord` for one caller-sanitized
   JSON object per line, without legacy message or metadata decoration.
 - **FIX**(storage): serialize appends, snapshots, migrations and disposal
   behind one queue and a cross-process lock, using Web Locks in the browser.
 - **FEAT**(export): `DragonLogs.clearLogs` also removes cached exports.
 - **FIX**(export): keep the artefacts of a running export out of that clear.
   Writing and sharing deliberately run outside the storage queue, so a clear
   could otherwise delete the snapshot being read or the file being shared.
 - **FIX**(export): share native export ownership across storage instances in
   one isolate using canonical paths, and serialize snapshot cleanup with clear.
   Retention survives disposal; concurrent shares use separate cache directories.
