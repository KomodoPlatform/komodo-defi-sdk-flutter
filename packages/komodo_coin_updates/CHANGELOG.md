## 2.1.1-rc.1

 - **SECURITY**(seed-nodes): keep the configured URL out of seed-node fetch
   failures by building the URI inside the same diagnostic boundary as transport
   and response parsing, and raising a dedicated failure type.

## 2.1.0

 - **FEAT**(config): add `CoinConfigTransformer.additionalTransforms`, applied
   after the built-in normalization set so an application can amend normalized
   asset configuration without replacing SDK defaults.
 - **FEAT**(tron): add `TronQuickNodeTransform`, keeping mainnet TRX and TRC20
   assets pointed at the Gleec proxy while preserving upstream fallback nodes.
 - **FIX**(custom-tokens): stop rejecting a re-store of an existing custom token
   as a contract collision. Assets read back through `AssetAdapter` are rebuilt
   without known parent ids, so the stored copy never carries a `parentId`;
   comparing that absence against a live parsed parent made every `upsert` and
   `addCustomTokenIfNotExists` on an existing token throw. Parents are now only
   compared when both sides carry one - a differing contract address still
   conflicts.
