## 0.6.0 (unreleased)

 - **FEAT**(private-keys): add the structured per-asset export result types used
   by `SecurityManager.exportPrivateKeys`, and carry `viewingKey` and
   `zDerivationPath` on private-key metadata.
 - **FEAT**(diagnostics): add `DiagnosticSanitizer` for metadata-only
   diagnostics, and expose the shared sensitive-field taxonomy through
   `SecurityUtils.isSensitiveDiagnosticKey`.
 - **SECURITY**(diagnostics): reduce every non-primitive value to `<redacted>`
   when censoring recursively, treat a non-string key as sensitive, and give
   key-bearing types a redacting `toString()`.

 - **CHORE**(deps): align workspace requirements with SDK 0.8.0:
   `komodo_defi_rpc_methods` `^0.7.0`.

## 0.5.0 — preparation history

> Note: This release has breaking GasFree withdrawal interfaces.

 - **BREAKING** **FEAT**(gasfree): align provider activation, fee preview,
   signed relay, submission, and receipt models with the final KDF contract.
 - **BREAKING** **FIX**(gasfree): obtain accepted trace identity and final fee
   from submission/trace status instead of preview or provider echoes.
 - **BREAKING** **FIX**(withdraw): enforce mutually exclusive explicit-amount
   and maximum request modes, omitting `amount` whenever `max` is true.
 - **SECURITY**(gasfree): persist only wallet-scoped journal and trace recovery
   data, never signed authorization material or provider credentials.
 - **FEAT**(gasfree): rename the local reservation identity to `journalId`;
   migrate trace-backed records and keep trace-less records outcome-unknown.
 - **BREAKING** **REFACTOR**(activation): remove `BatchActivationProgress`.
   Multi-asset progress is now tracked by the SDK's activation coordinator and
   surfaced as `AssetActivationState`; `ActivationProgress` itself is unchanged.
 - **FEAT**(activation): add `AssetActivationState` and `AssetActivationStatus`
   for per-asset activation state with a guaranteed terminal value.
 - **FEAT**(pubkeys): add `HdGapLimit`, which resolves the HD address gap to
   scan - 3 by default, 1 on a newly generated wallet's first sign-in, and the
   full 20 for hardware wallets.
 - **FIX**(transactions): treat an absent `received_by_me` or `spent_by_me` as
   zero when converting a KDF transaction, rather than parsing null.
 - **SECURITY**(logging): replace the log-censoring key list with a set that
   also covers authorization headers, bearer/API tokens, cookies and GasFree
   authorization material, and redact to `<redacted>` rather than a run of
   asterisks that leaked the value's length.
 - **FIX**(deps): declare the `flutter_test` dev dependency that
   `sia_protocol_test.dart` imports.
 - **CHORE**(analysis): drop two null assertions the analyzer proves are
   no-ops, which `dart pub publish` reports as warnings.

## 0.4.1 — preparation history
